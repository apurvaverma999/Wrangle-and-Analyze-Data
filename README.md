# Wrangle-and-Analyze-Data
WeRateDogs is a Twitter account that rates people's dogs with a humorous comment about the dog. The account was started in 2015 by college student Matt Nelson, and has received international media attention both for its popularity and for the attention drawn to social media copyright law when it was suspended by Twitter for breaking these aforementioned laws. The account's language has spawned an Internet language about "doggos" and "puppers". A 2016 interaction with another Twitter user, when Nelson purposefully misnamed him "Brent" as is common in Weird Twitter, spawned the catchphrase "They're good dogs, Brent", which became one of the biggest memes of 2016. In this project I'll analyze the dataframes to communicate useful findings.
